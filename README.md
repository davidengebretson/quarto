## About

Quarto is an open source STEM publishing system. It origin is in the R
statistics language. Quarto produces documents in multiple formats,
include HTML and PDF. It is based on Markdown. Via MathJax it has good
math support. It is a strong candidate for producing accessible
outputs, particular for blind users. This is a Quarto website.

## Goals

The present intention is to focus on provide some examples of
accessible Latex help, and of cheat sheets for blind students taking a
math module. In these specialist areas, feedback from users is really
important to ensure accessibility and other user needs. This is
particularly important at the early stages.

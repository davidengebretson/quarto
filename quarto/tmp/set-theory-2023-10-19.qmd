## About

## Inequalities (numbers)

If $a$ and $b$ are numbers, then exactly one of the following is true:

- $a < b$
- $a > b$
- $a = b$

This is called the **law of trichotomy**.

## Inequalities (sets)

Sets do not obey the law of trichotomy. For example, none of the
following are true:

- $\{1\} \subset \{2\}$
- $\{1\} \supset \{2\}$
- $\{1\} = \{2\}$

## Here's a feature

Spaces seem not to matter when you are in math mode. But they do seem
to matter when in delimiting of math mode. [Most users will not
understand this previous sentence.]

- $\{1\}\subset\{2\}$
- $ \{1\} \subset \{2\}$

## Union

[This contains the minimum needed to teach the Latex.]

$$
X = A \cup B
$$

- Words: X equals A union B
- Latex: `X = A \cup B`

## Intersection

[This contains the minimum needed to teach the math.]

The intersection of two sets $A$ and $B$ are the objects $x$ that are
members of $A$ and a member of $B$. The intersection is written as:

$$
X = A \cap B
$$

- Example: $\{1, 3, 5, 7\} \cap \{3, 5, 9\} = \{3, 5\}$.
- Example: $3 \in A$ and $3 \in B$ so $3 \in (A\cap B)$.

## Subset

## Superset
